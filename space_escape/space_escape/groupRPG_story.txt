You wake up. You see yourself in a cell by yourself. 
The last thing you remember was hiking on a mountain near where you live when a bright flash opened in the sky.
You need to get information on where you are and how you can get home. 
You look around and you see guards patrolling the corridors, and other people on different cells. 
You think maybe the other people have some might know how to get home but first you figure you must get out of this cell.
