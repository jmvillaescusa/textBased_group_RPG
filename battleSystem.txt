- Turned-based combat
- The player encounters an enemy as they move through the map (esentially random encounters)
- boss battles 
- The battle ends when either the enemies or the player dies first
- If the enemies dies first, the player will be rewarded EXP points and maybe an item (healing items, objective related items, etc.)
- If the player dies, game over
- Turn order will be determined by speed stat
  - For example:
    - Fighting an enemy:
      1. Player
      2. Enemy
    - Fighting multiple enemies:
      1. Enemy
      2. Player
      3. Enemy
    - Fighting a boss, and that boss calls reinforcements:
      1. Boss Enemy
      2. Player
      3. Enemy
      4. Enemy
